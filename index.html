<p> I am Jacqueline Gertner, a first year MA Public HIstory student at Northeastern University. I received my honors undergraduate degree at St. Bonaventure University in 2015 where I majored in History and minored in French. While there, I produced an honors thesis that discussed World War II Disney propaganda films. I have interned at the Friedsam Memorial Library Archives in which I created a display for alumnus Fred McCarthy, and added biographical information about him on the archive's website. I also interned at the Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts where I created panels discussing the different types of print, and I also created panels for the "White House Christmas Cards" exhibit. I currently work at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston as the MVS Audio Guide Assistant.</p>
